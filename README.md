   JavaScript Learning:


  I am doing the javascript learning daily by solving assignments. i took assignments from net or asking assignments to chatGpt to develope my coding skill.

My first assignments is to write a program that prints the numbers from 1 to 100. But for multiples of three, print "Fizz" instead of the number, and for the multiples of five, print "Buzz." For numbers that are multiples of both three and five, print "FizzBuzz."

- Code contains for loop which iterate the 1 to 100 number and then used if else condition in for loop to check the
- if number is multiple of 3 then print "Fizz"
- if number is multiple of 5 then print "Buzz"
- if number is multiple of 3 and 5 then print "FizzBuzz"

I learned to use if else in for loop effectively.
